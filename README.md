## Challenge Details
Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge that provides a series of programming puzzles designed to be solved with any programming language. Each day presents two related coding problems that test algorithmic thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity.

## Learning Objectives
- Develop proficiency in Python
- Practice algorithmic problem-solving
- Explore diverse computational thinking approaches
- Improve code efficiency and readability

## Personal Growth
This repository documents my journey through the Advent of Code 2024, showcasing incremental learning and problem-solving skills development in Python.

## Approach
Each day's solutions demonstrate:
- Algorithmic problem-solving
- Python programming techniques
- Creative approach to computational challenges

## Common Patterns
- Utility files (`utils.py`), (`extractions.py`), etc for shared helper functions
- Separate files for part1 and part2 to maintain clear problem separation
- Input files for puzzle-specific data

## Learning Journey
A documented exploration of Python programming skills and problem decomposition

## Notes
- Solutions are implemented with a focus on readability and efficiency
- Utility files provide shared functionality across solutions
